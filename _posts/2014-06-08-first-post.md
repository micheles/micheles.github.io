title: Back to the world of technical blogging!
---

I have been writing papers for years and I have kept a techical
blog on [Artima](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=micheles)
for a while, but some time ago I got lost in other kind of writings and
I stopped blogging for nearly four years. In the meanwhile I have switched
job from financial risk to seismic risk and changed employer from a
privately held company to a nonprofit foundation.

Now I am back. Since nowadays most of my time is taken by the OpenQuake
Engine I am going to write about it, instead of dabbling with obscure
technicalities and unpopular programming languages.

This is my first post; at the moment I am just trying to master the
blogging system of GitHub Pages, by following the recommendations
I found [here](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/).
It is a system that makes a lot of sense to me, one that I wanted
since the first time I started to use a revision control system,
more than ten years ago. I have been using a hand-crafted version
of the same ideas for a long time (I mean writing papers in plain text
under revision control and converting them into HTML at publication time);
finally I see that such ideas have caught up, even if ten years too late.

Everything seems to be working as advertised, I just need to figure out
how to modify the presentation details, such as the font size, the
background, et cetera. I have already got the navigation bar under
control and I am going to check how to enable [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)
comments. Then I will be ready to write my first real post, which will be
about the structure of the engine and its underlying libraries.

Stay tuned!
