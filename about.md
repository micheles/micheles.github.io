title: The OpenQuake Engine
---

The OpenQuake Engine is a set of libraries, a software framework and a
command line tool to compute seismic hazard and seismic risk on a global scale.

It is the main product of the GEM Foundation and was developed 
as an Open Source project with several contributors, starting from 2010.
I joined GEM in October 2012 and since January 2014 I have become
the main developer of the engine.

This blog aims to document my daily work on the engine, as well as my
ideas on its development and its future. My ideas are my own, and they
do not necessarily reflect the official view of GEM, unless I
explicitly say so. The development of the engine and of all GEM
products is a mediation between the *desiderata* of the GEM scientific
staff and the needs of the users, by taking into account
the directives of the governing board and the suggestions of the sponsors
of the foundation. I can just assess the technical feasibility of
projects and the estimated effort to implement them.

Who should follow this blog? I am writing primarily for the users
of the engine, to keep them informed of the progress we are making,
and to solicit comments and feedback. The blog posts here are also
forwarded to the [openquake-users]
(https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/openquake-users) mailing list.

Some posts will serve as documentation of the engine and may
be moved to the official docs later on. Other posts will serve to
provide the background and explanations for certain technical
decisions.

The requests of the users are tracked in our [public bug tracker]
(https://bugs.launchpad.net/oq-engine/+bugs?orderby=status); notice
that, despite the name, 90% of the "bugs" listed there are not actually bugs
but just requests for new features and improvements.

If you are a skilled developer, you can follow the development on the
[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/gem/), since it is
entirely public, and not a single code line enters in the engine code base
without an open review. This blog is for the ones who care
about the development of the engine but do not have the time or the
expertise to follow the code reviews.
